                    <h2>What Is The Hour of Code</h2>
                    <p>The Hour of Code was launched in December 2013 and is an international movement aiming to introduce millions of students to computer science through one-hour coding activities. 
                        These sessions help the students understand the basics of the field and get excited about the field of computer science. With support from more than 400 partners and 
                        participation from over 20,000 educators each year, the program has reached tens of millions of students in the United States and over 180 countries, including Canada, Italy, 
                        Saudi Arabia, Poland, and India. You can visit <a href="https://hourofcode.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Hour of Code</i></a> website to learn more.</p>

                    <h2>Our Report</h2> 

                    <p>This report, which was mainly made by <a href="./team-members.html"><i>Elmar Verdiyev</i></a>, effectively captures the key moments of the Hour of Code, highlighting the team's 
                        efforts, successes, and fails with clear and engaging writing.</p>   

                    <br>
                    <p>The Hour of Code was organized by Team 18 members at Baku Secondary School Number 200 on the 1st of November 2024. Prior to the event, each member of the team was asked 
                        to go through the information in the ADA University presentation and familiarize themselves with it. The team leader also informed the team members of the location, time, 
                        responsibilities, goals, and expected results to be achieved by the end of the event. <br><br> Originally, the event was supposed to begin at 9:45. However, due to the 
                        absence of the director of the school at the time of our arrival, the team could not be sanctioned and could not enter the classroom. As a result, the event had to be postponed 
                        by 50 minutes. The event officially began at 10:35, once all 20 students were seated in their places. The presenter’s laptop was prepared, and the projector found in the 
                        classroom was switched on. The language of instruction was determined as Azerbaijani.<br><br> Initially, the team members were introduced to the class. Then, three of the team 
                        members started to provide information regarding ADA University to the students, while the fourth member oversaw the filming of the presentation. The information included 
                        details about ADA University’s various schools, statistical information on the acceptance rates for different examination routes, and financial scholarships, among other topics.
                        <br><br> Afterwards, the students were informed of the coding exercises they would be solving. One of the team members provided the students with the link to the website. 
                        Initially, the students had difficulty finding the website until the member wrote the link down on the board. Another member described the basic components of the website and its
                         functionality, gave information about the various code blocks provided by the website, and explained how to connect them. The “Show code” button was described to the students as
                          a feature that reveals the actual programming language behind the code blocks. This button allowed the students to observe real code rather than simplified blocks.<br>
                          <br> Before allowing the students to begin, they were advised to work independently and call the team members in case of any issues. Additionally, the team members walked 
                          around to check the progress made by the students. One of the students had issues regarding the network connectivity of their laptop. A solution was quickly provided by 
                          replacing the faulty laptop with a working alternative.<br><br> As observed by the members, the children successfully completed many of the exercises while also learning from 
                          the video materials provided by the website. The theme of the exercises, Angry Birds, added an element of entertainment to the coding process, effectively gamifying it. However, 
                          certain issues were experienced during the exercises by some students. A few had difficulties finding solutions to the exercises, while others required hints to progress. 
                          Similarly, some students did not efficiently implement algorithms to solve the problems, as indicated by the website's light-green markers. The team members were quick to 
                          respond to the students’ issues.<br><br> At the end of the event, prior to the students leaving the class, the team members conducted a survey by asking various questions 
                          regarding the exercises and the overall event. The first question asked was about the students’ satisfaction level with the event. The response was overwhelmingly positive, 
                          with students agreeing that the event was a fun and educational way to learn about the fundamental aspects of computer science.<br><br> The second question asked was about 
                          their previous experience with such an event. The students responded that they had attended a similar event before, which explained their relative ease in accomplishing the 
                          tasks. Some students also mentioned the challenges experienced with the new set of exercises as part of their feedback.<br><br> After the survey, the students were allowed 
                          to leave the room, and the event was considered finished. The team noted the organization and execution of the event as a success. The director’s decision to grant permission 
                          for the team to teach a class full of young and bright minds the fundamental ideas of technological sciences was greatly appreciated. Furthermore, the team expressed gratitude 
                          to the class teacher for her assistance with certain technical issues experienced at the beginning of the event and for providing her time. Her support greatly simplified the 
                          process.</p>
